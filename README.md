# aws-export-credentials
**Get AWS credentials from a profile to inject into other programs**

There are a number of other projects that extract AWS credentials and/or
inject them into programs, but all the ones I've seen use the CLI's cache
files directly, rather than leveraging botocore's ability to retrieve and
refresh credentials. So I wrote this to do that.

[botocore (the underlying Python SDK library)](https://botocore.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) has added support for loading credentials cached by [`aws sso login`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/sso/login.html) as of [version 1.17.0](https://github.com/boto/botocore/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.rst#1170).
`aws-export-credentials` now requires botocore >= 1.17.0, and so supports AWS SSO credentials as well.
If all you want is AWS SSO support for an SDK other than Python, Go, or JavaScript (v3), take a look at [aws-sso-util](https://github.com/benkehoe/aws-sso-util#adding-aws-sso-support-to-aws-sdks), which can help you configure your profiles with a [credential process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sourcing-external.html) that doesn't require the credential injection process that `aws-export-credentials` does.

## Quickstart

I recommend you install [`pipx`](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/), which installs the tool in an isolated virtualenv while linking the script you need.

```bash
# with pipx
pipx install aws-export-credentials

# without pipx
python3 -m pip install --user aws-export-credentials

# run it
aws-export-credentials
{
  "Version": 1,
  "AccessKeyId": "<your access key here>",
  "SecretAccessKey": "<shhh it's your secret key>",
  "SessionToken": "<do you ever wonder what's inside the session token?>"
}
```

## Usage
### Profile
Profiles work like in the AWS CLI (since it uses botocore); it will pick up the `AWS_PROFILE`
or `AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE` env vars, but the `--profile` argument takes precedence.

### JSON
```
aws-export-credentials --profile my-profile --json [--pretty]
```
Print the credentials to stdout as a JSON object compatible with the `credential_process`
spec. If `--pretty` is added, it'll be pretty-printed.

### Env vars
```
aws-export-credentials --profile my-profile --env
export $(aws-export-credentials --profile my-profile --env)
eval $(aws-export-credentials --profile my-profile --env-export)
```
Print the credentials as environment variables. With `--env-export`, the lines are prefixed
by "`export `".

### Exec wrapper
```
aws-export-credentials --profile my-profile --exec echo 'my access key id is $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'
```
Execute the arguments after `--exec` using `os.system()`, injecting the credentials through
environment variables.

### `~/.aws/credentials`
```
aws-export-credentials --profile my-profile --credentials-file-profile my-exported-profile
aws-export-credentials --profile my-profile -c my-exported-profile
```
Put the credentials in the given profile in your [shared credentials file](https://ben11kehoe.medium.com/aws-configuration-files-explained-9a7ea7a5b42e), which is typically `~/.aws/credentials` but can be controlled using the environment variable [`AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html).

## Caching
To avoid retrieving credentials every time when using `aws-export-credentials` with the same identity, you can cache the credentials in a file using the `--cache-file` argument.
**Note `aws-export-credentials` does not distinguish between different identities in the cache. Different identities should use different cache files.**
If you do not account for this, credentials may be loaded from the cache and exported that do not correspond to the credentials that would be exported without the cache.
This may look like, for example, using a cache file named after the config profile you are exporting.

Cache loading and saving fails silently, to ensure caching does not interrupt usage.
If caching is not working, you can see the details with `--debug`.

By default, cached credentials are considered expired if their expiration is less than 10 minutes in the future.
You can change this value using the `--cache-expiration-buffer` argument, which takes a number of minutes.

You can force the cache to refresh using `--refresh`.
